# Age-Gender-Detection
A model that can predict and analyze the age and gender of any human being.

First you need to download a data set from Kaggel named as UTKFace and then you need to train the model accordingly by first running the model.ipynb file then the main.ipynb and at last the cam.py as a GUI interface.
